# The Tower

The Tower is a 2D side-scrolling platformer game implemented by You Fing Feng and I for our Independent Software Engineering Project (Orbital 2020), for which we have attained a level of achievement Project Gemini. 
In this repository, I have made improvements to the code with some refactoring such that it is cleaner and conforms more to Software Engineering principles.
