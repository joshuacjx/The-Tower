# The Tower

The Tower is a 2D side-scrolling platformer game implemented by You Fing Feng and I for our CS2106 Independent Software Engineering Project (Orbital 2020), for which we have attained a level of achievement Project Gemini. Post-Orbital, I intend to improve on this project by designing my own assets and making use of the skills learnt in the CS2103 software engineering module.
